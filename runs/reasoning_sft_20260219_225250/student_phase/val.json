The reference to 'FEMA camps' and 'penal camps' could imply targeting immigrants or refugees, but without explicit group-based targeting of a protected class, this falls under the exception for 'if the target is an individual without reference to group identity' or 'if the language is used metaphorically to criticize non-group-based entities.'
