The text 'Can I get a shoutout pleaseeeeee I only have a little bit of people :(' contains no dehumanizing language, no derogatory terms targeting any protected group, no violent suggestions, and no group-based hostility. It is a personal request for social media engagement without any reference to race, gender, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristics. All rules specify exceptions for non-group-based language, and this text clearly falls under those exceptions as it targets no group and contains no hostile intent.

There is no dehumanizing or derogatory language, no violent suggestions, and no hostile intent toward any group. The mention of 'disabled, Dyslexic or intelligent' could potentially reference disability/ability groups, but it's framed neutrally as part of a broader inclusive statement. No exceptions apply as there's no offensive language to exempt. Applying Rule 002: Similar analysis - the text lists protected groups but does so to promote equality and human commonality ('we all are people'). No derogatory generalizations, dehumanizing terms, or violent suggestions are present. The context is explicitly non-hostile. Applying Rule 003: Same conclusion - the text references multiple protected groups but in a context that affirms their humanity rather than targeting them with hostility. The phrase 'Quality!' appears to express approval of this inclusive sentiment. All rules indicate this text lacks the key indicators for hate speech: no dehumanizing terms, no derogatory generalizations with hostile intent, no violent suggestions, and no reinforcement of harmful stereotypes.", "teacher_pred_label": 0, "parse_source": "json"}

It's a playful reinterpretation of the ADIDAS acronym without any group targeting, hostile intent, or reinforcement of harmful stereotypes. No exceptions apply as there's no protected group reference. Applying Rule 002: Same analysis - no dehumanizing language, group targeting, or hostile intent toward protected groups. Applying Rule 003: Same analysis - the text is metaphorical but targets no group-based entities or individuals with group identity references.

There is no dehumanizing or derogatory group-based language, no violent suggestions, and no reinforcement of harmful stereotypes. The criticism is directed at the president's actions, not at any protected group. Applying Rule 002: The text does not contain dehumanizing terms, derogatory generalizations about protected groups, or violent suggestions toward groups. The focus is on supporting refugees and criticizing political leadership, without group-based hostility. Applying Rule 003: Similar analysis to Rules 001 and 002 - no triggering patterns are present. The text expresses positive support for refugees and political activism, with criticism limited to individual political figures rather than protected groups.

However, this term is not dehumanizing (e.g., 'pigs', 'retarded'), does not target a protected group (racial, gender, religious, national, sexual orientation), and lacks hostile intent indicators like suggestions of elimination, inferiority, or violence toward a group. The target appears to be an individual ('that nerdy guy') without reference to group identity, and there's no reinforcement of harmful stereotypes in a hostile context. The term 'nerdy' is used colloquially to describe an individual's characteristics, not to promote group-based hostility. Applying Rule 002: Similar analysis - no dehumanizing terms, derogatory generalizations about protected groups, or violent suggestions with group targeting. The comment targets an individual's perceived traits ('nerdy') without targeting a protected group or promoting generalized hostility. Applying Rule 003: Again, no dehumanizing terms, derogatory generalizations about protected groups, or violent suggestions with group targeting. The language is not metaphorical criticism of non-group-based entities, and the target is an individual without reference to group identity.

This constitutes derogatory generalization about a protected group (sexual orientation) with hostile intent, as it reinforces harmful stereotypes about LGBTQ+ individuals. No exceptions apply - this is not reclaimed, clinical, historical, or satirical context; it directly targets a group identity rather than individual behavior. Applying Rule 002: The text uses derogatory language targeting a protected group (sexual orientation) with implied inferiority through association with disease. This meets the trigger pattern for dehumanizing/derogatory group-based language. No exceptions apply as this is not criticism of individual behavior without group targeting.

The target appears to be an individual ('woman') without clear reference to group identity or protected characteristics. The comment lacks indicators of (1) non-literal/metaphorical slurs, (2) suggestions of elimination/inferiority/violence toward a group, or (3) reinforcement of harmful stereotypes in a hostile context. While potentially offensive, it does not meet the trigger pattern for group-based language with hostile intent. Applying Rule 002: Similar analysis - no dehumanizing terms, derogatory generalizations about protected groups, or violent suggestions with group targeting. The comment targets an individual expression of disgust without promoting generalized hostility toward women as a protected group.

Notice the blatant subliminal messages.", "label": 1, "reasoning": "Applying Rule 001: The text uses derogatory terms 'homo' and 'faggot' which are slurs targeting the LGBTQ+ community (a protected group based on sexual orientation). This constitutes dehumanizing/derogatory group-based language. The context appears hostile as it's used to insult an individual (Spike Lee) while invoking his group identity. No exceptions apply - this is not reclaimed usage (not self-referential), not clinical/historical discussion, not satirical critique of hate speech, and not metaphorical criticism of non-group entities. The targeting of an individual (Spike Lee) specifically references his group identity ('homo faggot'), making it group-based hostility rather than individual criticism without group reference. Applying Rule 002: Same analysis applies - derogatory group-based language with hostile intent targeting protected group (LGBTQ+). No exception for individual behavior criticism applies since the insult is based on group identity. Applying Rule 003: Same analysis - dehumanizing terms targeting protected group with hostile intent, not metaphorical or reclaimed usage.", "teacher_pred_label": 1, "parse_source": "json"}

It reinforces harmful stereotypes by suggesting violent behavior ('slapping a white man') and includes dehumanizing terms ('ass'). This constitutes group-based targeting with derogatory generalizations, meeting the trigger pattern of dehumanizing or derogatory language with hostile intent.
